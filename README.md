# Rock-Paper-Scissor-in-CPP

Rock-paper-scissors is a simple, hand-based game that is played by two people. The game is played by both players simultaneously showing one of three hand signs representing rock, paper, or scissors. The winner is determined by the rules below:

Rock beats scissors (rock crushes scissors)
Scissors beats paper (scissors cut paper)
Paper beats rock (paper covers rock)
If both players show the same hand sign, the game is a tie.

This particular rock-paper-scissors game is implemented as a computer program that allows a player to play against the computer. The player can enter their choice of rock, paper, or scissors by entering the corresponding number (0 for rock, 1 for paper, or 2 for scissors). The computer then generates its own choice using a pseudo-random number generator and the game is played according to the rules described above. The result of the game is then displayed to the player, and the player has the option to play again if they wish. The game continues until the player decides to stop playing.
